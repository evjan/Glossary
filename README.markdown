Glossary
========
A simple Glossary ASP.NET MVC application. The functionality is not very complex, what is more interesting is the approach to testing: how easy it can be to run browser tests with Selenium WebDriver to verify the user stories.

Setting up
==========
You need the following dependencies to get up and running with this project:

* A recent version of NuGet that supports Package Restore (I use 1.6). NuGet automatically downloads the external libraries the first time you build the project.
* IIS 7.5 Express (install through Web Platform Installer)
